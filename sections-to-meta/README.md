# Section-to-meta - Lua filter for Pandoc to capture `abstract`, `thanks` and `keywords` sections in the metadata

The pre-render Lua filter for [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) allows
you to enter some metadata fields as sections at the beginning of
the document. The filter identifies sections with special titles
and moves them to the document's metadata.

Description
===========

Pandoc markdown provides `thanks`, `abstract`, `keywords` metadata fields. 
This filter allows you to specify them as sections in the
document itself. There are two reasons to do this:

- if your source document is e.g. `docx`, you can enter sections that
  Pandoc will parse as such, but no metadata field. Thus this filter
  allows you to automatically fill the `thanks`, `abstract` and `keywords`
  fields based on `docx` or other import formats.
- Entering blocks in a metadata YAML block is error-prone for users
  unfamiliar with YAML indentation rules. Allowing them to enter
  these fields in the document itself is easier.

The filter also provides a `reviewof` field intended for book reviews. 

Usage
=====

Use headings to mark out your abstract, acknowledgments, and keywords:

```markdown
---
title: My article
author: Jane E. Doe
---

# Abstract

This is a short and sweet article.

# Keywords

- science
- art

# Thanks

I'm grateful to my parents and family.

# Review of 

[Doe]{.smallcaps}, Jane, *Last but not least*, Fancy Press, 2018, 320 pp.

# Introduction

The article's body starts (and ends) here.
```

* The metadata sections must be at the beginning of the document. 
  The document's body will start wherever the filter encounters a
  horizontal line or a header whose title isn't one of "Abstract" etc. Headers titled "Summary" or the like lower in the document
  will be treated as ordinary document sections. 
* If you don't have a heading (`# Introduction`) to separate the 
  abstract/thanks/keywords from the rest of the text, use a 
  [horizontal rule](#https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#horizontal-rules).
  In markdown make sure you leave an empty line before a `---` rule, 
  otherwise the text above is read as a heading.
  In source formats whose horizontal rules are
  not recognized as such by Pandoc (e.g. MS Word), you can still achieve the
  same effect by using a separate paragraph containing only `* * *`. 
* The keyword section must be a bullet point list. 
  Any other content in that section will be ignored.
* Metadata section titles are case-insensitive (`Abstract`, `ABSTRACT`
  and `abstract` all work). Aliases are provided: `Summary` for `Abstract`,
  `Acknowledgements` and `Acknowledgments` for `thanks`. 
* The `abstract`, `keywords` and `thanks` headings can be of any level.
  They will end at the next header, whichever level it is. Thus your document's headers can be 
  of level 2 or lower if you wish: `## Introduction` works just
  as well to terminate the abstract/thanks/keywords.
