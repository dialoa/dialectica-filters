  Vindicating the claim that agents ought to be consistent
  has proved to be a difficult task. Recently, some have argued that we
  can use accuracy-dominance arguments to vindicate the normativity of
  such requirements. But what do these arguments prove, exactly? In this
  paper, I argue that we can make a distinction between two theses on the 
  normativity of consistency: the view that one ought to be consistent and
  the view that one ought to avoid being inconsistent. I argue that
  accuracy-dominance arguments for consistency support the latter view,
  but not necessarily the former. I also argue that the distinction
  between these two theses matters in the debate on the normativity of
  epistemic rationality. Specifically, the distinction suggests that there
  are interesting alternatives to vindicating the strong claim that one
  ought to be consistent.

The normativity of the following formal coherence requirements is
contentious:

::: statement
**Belief Consistency**. If A believes that P, it is false that A
believes that $\neg$P.[^1]
:::

::: statement
**Credal Consistency**. If A has a credence of X in P, then A has a
credence of (1-X) in $\neg$P.
:::

\noindent Do we fall under an obligation to satisfy these requirements?[^2] Many
philosophers like John Broome [-@broome:2013, ch. 13] are convinced that the
above requirements are normative, but cannot find a satisfactory
argument in favour of such a conclusion. Other philosophers are less
optimistic. For instance, Niko Kolodny [-@kolodny:2005; -@kolodny:2007; -@kolodny:2007a, 230--231] has
argued that there is no reason to be consistent. According to him, what
matters from an epistemic point of view is acquiring true beliefs (or
acquiring beliefs that are likely to be true on the evidence) and
avoiding false beliefs (or avoiding beliefs that are likely to be false
on the evidence). However, a perfectly consistent system of beliefs (or
credences) can be entirely false, inaccurate or improbable on the
evidence. So, consistency requirements are not normative, in the sense
that one does not necessarily have a reason to be consistent.

Recently, a new strategy has emerged to vindicate the normativity of
Consistency. This strategy relies on accuracy-dominance principles,
which roughly say that if state $Y$ is better than state $X$ at every
possible world, one ought to avoid state $X$. However, there is a weak and
a strong interpretation of what is entailed by the accuracy-dominance
arguments. According to the strong interpretation, accuracy-dominance
arguments entail that one ought to be consistent. Joyce, for instance,
argues that:

> It is thus established that degrees of belief that violate the laws of
> probability are invariably less accurate than they could be. Given that
> an epistemically rational agent will always strive to hold partial
> beliefs that are as accurate as possible, this vindicates the
> fundamental dogma of probabilism [according to which degrees of belief
> must make conformity to the axioms of probability]. [-@joyce_jm:1998, 600]

According to the weak interpretation, accuracy-dominance arguments
merely entail that ought not to be inconsistent. Easwaran, for instance,
says that "we can use dominance to *eliminate*" the inconsistent
doxastic options [-@easwaran:2016b, 826, emphasis added]. In other words,
dominance is here used to argue against inconsistency. Thus, we can make
the following distinction between two views:

::: statement
**Normativity+**. Given the accuracy-dominance arguments, A ought to be
consistent.
:::

::: statement
**Normativity-**. Given the accuracy-dominance arguments, A ought not to
be inconsistent. 
:::

\noindent This paper argues that, while accuracy-dominance arguments can vindicate
Normativity-, they do not necessarily vindicate Normativity+.
Specifically, accuracy-dominance arguments vindicate Normativity+ when
supplemented with a contentious hypothesis concerning the relationship
between reasons for and reasons against. Hence, accuracy-dominance
arguments do not vindicate Normativity+ *on their own*.

In [@Sec:the-why-be-consistent-challenges], I clarify the debate on the normativity of Consistency. In Sections [-@Sec:accuracy-dominance-and-consistency] and [-@Sec:truth-conduciveness-reasons-for-and-reasons-against], I present two important arguments in the debate
surrounding the normativity of Consistency: accuracy-dominance arguments
and Kolodny's objection from truth-conduciveness. Both arguments are
veritistic: They assume that only true beliefs bear final epistemic
value, and only false beliefs bear final epistemic disvalue. I argue
that, under the assumption that veritism is true, the only way to make
sense of both arguments is to make a distinction between Normativity+
and Normativity- (i.e. to deny that both views are coextensive). Then,
I argue that accuracy-dominance arguments fail to vindicate
Normativity+.

This is not necessarily bad news. In conclusion, I explain why this
might be an occasion to adjust our expectations in the debate on the
normativity of formal coherence requirements. Many people think that
there is something bad or suboptimal with inconsistent combinations of
attitudes. The mistake might have been to try to explain this assumption
in terms of *an obligation to be consistent*. Being in a position to
vindicate Normativity- while remaining neutral on Normativity+ could be
advantageous in the debate on the normativity of formal coherence
requirements.

# The "Why-Be-Consistent?" Challenges

There are many putative explanations of why one ought to have *some*
consistent combinations of beliefs. They stem from the normative
authority of truth, knowledge or reasons, as in the following:

::: statement
**Truth Vindication**. One ought to believe $P$ if and only if P. Truth is
consistent (or: Inconsistent propositions cannot be true
simultaneously). So, one ought to have some consistent combinations of
beliefs (e.g. the true ones).
:::
::: statement
**Knowledge Vindication**. One is epistemically permitted to believe P
if and only if one is in a position to know that P. Knowledge is
consistent (or: Propositions that one is in a position to know cannot be
inconsistent with each other). So, one is only epistemically permitted
to believe consistent combinations of beliefs.
:::
::: statement
**Reasons Vindication**. One is epistemically permitted to believe $P$ if
and only if one has sufficient epistemic reason to believe P. One never
has sufficient epistemic reason to believe $P$ and sufficient epistemic
reason to disbelieve $P$ simultaneously. So, one is only epistemically
permitted to believe consistent combinations of beliefs.[^3]
:::

\noindent Philosophers like @broome:2013 and others are worried that the above
putative vindications do not fully vindicate the normativity of
Consistency. Some consistent combinations of beliefs may include some
false, unjustified or unreasonable beliefs. Even if consistent agents
sometimes believe propositions that are false, unjustified or
unreasonable, it seems that they satisfy a distinct obligation to have
consistent beliefs (e.g. an obligation that does not boil down to
truth, knowledge or reasons). In other words, perhaps the agent is
unjustified, mistaken or unreasonable, but one could still say: *At
least he or she is consistent*. Here, the putative obligation to be
consistent will not come from truth, knowledge or reasons.[^4]

So, according to some philosophers, the above vindications are somehow
incomplete. Perhaps we can easily argue that agents ought to have *some*
consistent combinations of beliefs, but finding a vindication of
Consistency that covers all the possible consistent combinations of
beliefs has proved to be a difficult task.

It should also be noted that the normativity of Consistency is part of a
broader debate on the normativity of *structural rationality*.
Structural rationality allegedly requires of agents not to be
incoherent --- for example, not to be akratic, not to have intransitive
preferences, and so forth [@worsnip:2018b; @worsnip:2018]. So, in addition to
Consistency, there are other putative structural requirements of
rationality, like:

::: statement
**Inter-Level Coherence.** Rationality requires that, if A believes
that he or she has sufficient epistemic reason to believe P, then A
believes that P.[^5]
:::
::: statement
**Instrumental Principle**. Rationality requires that, if A intends
to $\phi$, and A believes that $\psi$-ing is a necessary means to $\phi$-ing, then
A intends to $\psi$.[^6]
:::

\noindent Broome and others have tried to find compelling arguments for the claim
that *structural rationality* has normative authority. However,
structural rationality is neutral on whether one's beliefs should be
true, reasonable or amount to knowledge. Some entirely false and
unreasonable belief systems can satisfy the requirements of structural
rationality. So, at least given the agenda of these philosophers, a good
vindication of the normativity of Consistency should cover the cases in
which one's beliefs are false or unreasonable.

An interesting feature of accuracy-dominance arguments is that they
remain neutral on whether one's beliefs should be true, reasonable or
amount to knowledge. They focus on what is wrong with having some
combinations of beliefs, regardless of the substantive properties of
such beliefs.

# Accuracy-Dominance and Consistency

Accuracy-dominance arguments for vindicating the normativity of
Consistency come from decision theory and rely on the following
principle:

::: statement
**Strong Dominance**. If an available state $X$ is strongly dominated by
an available state $Y$ at every possible world, in the sense that state $Y$
is better or has more value than state $X$ at every possible world, one
ought to avoid state $X$.
:::

\noindent Strong Dominance has been used to vindicate probabilism, the view
roughly stating that an agent's rational credences should satisfy the
probability axioms. With respect to some inaccuracy measures such as the
Brier score, probabilistically inconsistent agents have access to a
credence function that is less inaccurate (and thus less epistemically
disvaluable) at every possible world [@joyce_jm:1998; @leitgeb-pettigrew:2010; @pettigrew:2016].

For the sake of simplicity, I will leave aside dominance for credence
and focus on dominance for belief (these arguments have the same
structure, but dominance arguments for belief are more accessible).

There is a plausible explanation of why inconsistent combinations of
beliefs are strongly dominated. An agent can take different doxastic
attitudes towards $P$, as in the following:

(i) Believing $P$ and not disbelieving $P$,

(ii) Disbelieving $P$ and not believing $P$,

(iii) Neither believing nor disbelieving $P$,

(iv) Believing $P$ and disbelieving $P$.

The question is whether (iv) is strongly dominated. To answer this
question, we need to determine the epistemic value of (iv) at every
possible world. In veritistic frameworks, only true beliefs have final
epistemic value and only false beliefs have final epistemic disvalue.
Accordingly, $T$ is the epistemic value of having a true belief (for
$T > 0$), F is the epistemic disvalue of having a false belief (for $F < 0$),
and the epistemic value of not believing $P$ (or not disbelieving $P$) is
0.[^7] Finally, assume that $T \leftarrow F$, which amounts to endorsing a
conservative account of epistemic value. The conservative constraint on
epistemic value is plausible.[^8] As Dorst says:[^9]

> [An epistemically rational agent] will be doxastically
> conservative... Why? Well here's a fair coin --- does she believe it'll
> land heads? Or tails? Or both? Or neither? Clearly neither. But if she
> cared more about seeking truth than avoiding error, why not believe
> both? She'd then be guaranteed to get one truth and one falsehood, and
> so be more accurate than if she believed neither... Upshot: we impose a
> *Conservativeness* constraint to capture the sense in which Rachael has
> 'more to lose' in forming a belief than she does to gain. [-@dorst:2019, 11]

Then, we can determine the possible values of each option at every
possible world. Since the value of these options is solely determined by
P's truth value, we need to consider the worlds in which $P$ is true and
the worlds in which $P$ is false, as in the following table:

  Table 1.
  --------------------------------------- --------------- ----------------
  **Doxastic options / possible world**   **$P$ is true**   **$P$ is false**
  Believing $P$ and not disbelieving $P$      $T$               $F$
  Disbelieving $P$ and not believing $P$      $F$               $T$
  Neither believing nor disbelieving $P$    0               0
  Believing $P$ and disbelieving $P$          $T+F$             $T+F$
  --------------------------------------- --------------- ----------------

Finally, in accordance with Table 1, we can conclude that inconsistent
combinations of beliefs are strongly dominated. The following reasoning
supports such a conclusion:

(1) $T \leftarrow F$ (conservative assumption). Accordingly, $T+F < 0$.

(2) Following (1) and Table 1, believing $P$ and disbelieving $P$
    simultaneously has an epistemic value of less than 0 at every
    possible world.

(3) However, following Table 1, neither believing nor disbelieving $P$ has
    an epistemic value of 0 at every possible world.

(C) Therefore, following (2) and (3), inconsistent combinations of
    beliefs such as believing $P$ and disbelieving $P$ are strongly
    dominated: another available option (neither believing nor
    disbelieving $P$) is more valuable at every possible world.[^10]

Hence, one ought to avoid being inconsistent.

# Truth-Conduciveness, Reasons For and Reasons Against

## Kolodny's Objection From Truth-Conduciveness

The above argument states that inconsistent combinations of beliefs are
dominated, which means that one ought not to be inconsistent. Naturally,
this seems to suggest that one ought to be consistent. But this
equivalence is less obvious than it seems.

To see why, consider Kolodny's argument against the normativity of
Consistency. According to him, one does not necessarily have an
epistemic reason to be consistent. Rather, what matters from an
epistemic point of view is having true beliefs and avoiding false
beliefs, and satisfying Consistency does not guarantee a better ratio of
true to false beliefs. In fact, some perfectly consistent sets of
beliefs are entirely false (or improbable on the evidence). Kolodny
summarizes his argument in the following way:

> From the standpoint of theoretical deliberation --- which asks 'What ought
> I to believe?'---what ultimately matters is simply what is likely to be
> true, given what there is to go on. [...] [But] formal coherence may
> as soon lead one away from, as toward, the true and the good. Thus, if
> someone asks from the deliberative standpoint 'What is there to be said
> for making my attitudes formally coherent as such?' there seems, on
> reflection, no satisfactory answer. [-@kolodny:2007a, 231]

In other words, if one merely satisfies Consistency, one is not more
likely to end up forming true beliefs and avoiding false beliefs. So,
the mere satisfaction of Consistency does not improve one's ratio of
true to false beliefs. In view of the foregoing, Kolodny thinks that it
is false that one falls under an obligation to be consistent.[^11]

## Comparing the Objection from Truth-Conduciveness and Accuracy-Dominance Arguments

Kolodny argues that there is no reason to be consistent. His argument
relies on the fact that being consistent does not guarantee a good ratio
of true to false beliefs. By way of contrast, accuracy-dominance
arguments suggest that there is good reason not to be inconsistent. If
one is inconsistent, one is strongly dominated, in the sense that one
has access to a better option at every possible world. For instance, if
one believes $P$ and disbelieves $P$ simultaneously, one will necessarily
improve one's situation by neither believing nor disbelieving P.

Accuracy-dominance arguments and Kolodny's objection from
truth-conduciveness are both veritistic.[^12] Indeed, they presuppose
that only true beliefs bear final epistemic value, and only false
beliefs bear final epistemic disvalue. Nevertheless, such arguments
apparently support incompatible conclusions concerning the normativity
of Consistency: Kolodny argues that veritism entails the denial of the
normativity of Consistency, whereas accuracy-dominance arguments support
the normativity of Consistency. This is puzzling.

Perhaps Kolodny and accuracy-dominance theorists do not endorse the same
version of veritism. Veritism says that only true beliefs have final
epistemic value, and only false beliefs have final epistemic disvalue.
However, when it comes to epistemic obligations and permissions, these
assumptions concerning epistemic value might translate in many different
ways. For instance, perhaps agents ought to maximize their *total*
epistemic score (e.g. the total balance of epistemic value they get
from their doxastic states), or perhaps agents ought to maximize their
*expected* epistemic score. For clarity, consider the following example:
Suppose $P$ is very likely relative to a body of evidence E. But as it
happens, $P$ is false. Then, believing $P$ (or having a high credence in P)
might maximize expected epistemic value with respect to E. But
disbelieving $P$ (or having a low credence in P) will maximize epistemic
value *tout court*.

Yet, it is implausible that a difference in how Joyce and Kolodny
understand veritism is the reason why they disagree. Kolodny's argument
can be reformulated in many different ways. Consider the following
possibilities: (i) Suppose agents ought to maximize *expected* accuracy.
Then, Kolodny could say: Some consistent combinations of beliefs can
minimize expected accuracy (believing the most improbable propositions
can be consistent). (ii) Suppose agents ought to optimize their ratio of
true to false beliefs. Then, Kolodny could argue that some agents with a
very bad ratio of true to false beliefs are consistent. (iii) Suppose
agents ought to maximize *total* accuracy. Then, Kolodny could say: Some
consistent combinations of beliefs can minimize accuracy (believing
false propositions only can be consistent). As we can see, Kolodny's
objection is malleable.[^13]

Another possibility is that Kolodny and accuracy-first theorists have a
different understanding of what "ought" means. We can make a distinction
between normativity in the rule-following sense (as in: Relative to
domain D, A ought to X) and normativity in the reason-involving sense
(as in: A has a reason to X).[^14] For example, the rules of etiquette
require of agents to be polite, but agents might lack a reason to be
polite. By way of analogy with the rules of etiquette, perhaps
accuracy-first theorists are merely interested in arguing that the rules
of rationality require consistency. This would be compatible with
Kolodny's view --- namely, that agents do not have a reason to be
consistent. Both views would then be compatible with each other.

It is true that accuracy-first theorists see Consistency as a demand of
rationality. However, it is implausible that accuracy-first theorists
are *merely* concerned with normativity in the rule-following sense.
Accuracy-first theorists like Joyce tie norms of rationality to
epistemic value, as in the following:

::: statement
**The Norm of Truth**. An epistemically rational agent must strive to
hold a system of full beliefs that strikes the best attainable overall
balance between the epistemic good of fully believing truths and the
epistemic evil of fully believing falsehoods [@joyce_jm:1998, 577].
:::
::: statement
**The Norm of Gradational Accuracy.** An epistemically rational agent
must evaluate partial beliefs on the basis of their gradational
accuracy, and she must strive to hold a system of partial beliefs that,
in her best judgment, is likely to have an overall level of gradational
accuracy at least as high as that of any alternative system she might
adopt [@joyce_jm:1998, 579].
:::

\noindent Satisfying the requirements of rationality is different from, say,
satisfying the requirements of etiquette. The former has a privileged
relationship to value. Epistemically rational agents want to optimize
their overall balance of epistemic value. Accordingly, it would be
surprising that Joyce and others are merely concerned with normativity
in the rule-following sense. Specifically, it would be surprising that,
while rationality has some sort of privileged relationship to value, it
is merely normative in the rule-following sense.[^15]

Under the assumption that Kolodny and accuracy-dominance theorists agree
upon a specific version of veritism and the meaning of "ought," the
natural reaction is to think that at least one of the above arguments is
mistaken --- either the objection from truth-conduciveness is
inconclusive, or accuracy-dominance arguments fail. After all, how can
there be no reason to be consistent and reasons against being
inconsistent? If there is something wrong with being inconsistent, there
must be something good with being consistent!

However, this natural reaction presupposes that there is always a
connection between (i) reasons for being consistent (as in Normativity+)
and (ii) reasons against being inconsistent (as in Normativity-). Call
this the Coextensivity Thesis, as in the following:

::: statement
**Coextensivity Thesis**. Arguments in favour of Normativity- count as
arguments in favour of Normativity+ (and vice versa).
:::

\noindent Those who endorse the Coextensivity Thesis think that (i) and (ii)
express the same normative relation.

If the Coextensivity Thesis were correct, then Kolodny's objection from
truth-conduciveness would be inconclusive. Under the assumption that the
Coextensivity Thesis is correct, two kinds of considerations can
vindicate the view that one ought to be consistent --- namely, reasons be
consistent and reasons against being inconsistent. Kolodny argues for
the *absence* of reasons in favour of being consistent. But if the
Coextensivity Thesis is correct, 
*such considerations are just half of the story*. 
We also need to consider whether there are reasons against
being inconsistent in the balance, since they count as reasons for being
consistent. Accuracy-dominance arguments entail that one ought not to be
inconsistent. So, even if Kolodny is right that there is no reason to
satisfy Consistency, this does not entail that it is false that one
ought to be consistent. Insofar as there are arguments against
inconsistency (as suggested by accuracy-dominance arguments), there is a
reason to be consistent.

However, if the Coextensivity Thesis is false, then accuracy-dominance
arguments are compatible with the objection from
truth-conduciveness. Here is why. Kolodny argues that there is no reason
to be consistent: he denies that one ought to be consistent, as in
Normativity+. However, if the Coextensivity Thesis is false, we can deny
Normativity+ without denying Normativity-. In other words, even if it is
false that one ought to be consistent, perhaps one ought not to be
inconsistent. The same goes for accuracy-dominance arguments. According
to such arguments, inconsistent combinations of beliefs are dominated.
So, one ought not to be inconsistent. But if the Coextensivity Thesis is
false, this does not entail that one ought to be consistent.

## Reasons to be Consistent and the Coextensivity Thesis

So, is the Coextensivity Thesis true? This depends on what "a reason to
be consistent" means. Suppose, like Kolodny, that "a reason to be
consistent" concerns each individual consistent option one has (see
§3.1). That is, suppose that "a reason to be consistent" means something
like "a consideration that counts in favour of *each* individual
consistent options one has." For Kolodny, nothing can be said in favour
of some consistent combinations of attitudes. So, under this
interpretation of what "a reason to be consistent" means, we do not
necessarily have a reason to be consistent.

Relative to this interpretation of what "a reason to be consistent"
means, the Coextensitivity Thesis does not seem plausible. For reasons
found in @snedegar_j:2018, we can make a distinction between reasons for
Consistency (as in Normativity+) and reasons against inconsistency (as
in Normativity-). The distinction comes from the following account of
reasons for and reasons against endorsed by Snedegar:

> My view puts a strong condition on reasons for and a weak condition on
> reasons against. For some objective to provide a reason for an option,
> that option has to do the best with respect to the objective. For some
> objective to provide a reason against an option, that option only has to
> do worse than some alternative. [-@snedegar_j:2018, 737]

Snedegar roughly argues that the problem with views that lump together
reasons against and reasons for is that there can be good reasons not to
$\phi$, even if there are worse alternatives to $\phi$-ing.[^16] For instance,
suppose that I am trying to decide what to drink. I might have
conclusive reason not to drink gin, but this does not entail that I have
a reason to drink any beverage that isn't gin. I should definitely not
drink petrol, even if petrol isn't gin. This is compatible with my
having conclusive reason not to drink gin.

Snedegar's observation sits well with accuracy-dominance arguments
discussed in [@Sec:accuracy-dominance-and-consistency]. Indeed, recall the options agents have in table
1:

  Table 1.
  --------------------------------------- --------------- ----------------
  **Doxastic options / possible world**   **P is true**   **P is false**
  Believing $P$ and not disbelieving $P$      T               F
  Disbelieving $P$ and not believing $P$      F               T
  Neither believing nor disbelieving $P$    0               0
  Believing $P$ and disbelieving $P$          T+F             T+F
  --------------------------------------- --------------- ----------------

\noindent Clearly, there is conclusive reason not to go for the inconsistent
option, since neither believing nor disbelieving $P$ is better than being
inconsistent at every possible world. However, this does not entail that
there is a reason in favour of every alternative to the inconsistent
option. For instance, disbelieving $P$ when $P$ is true (or believing $P$ when
P is false) is worse than being inconsistent. So, as in the gin and
petrol case, reasons against inconsistency are logically weaker than
reasons for Consistency.

This suggests that accuracy-dominance arguments do not vindicate
Normativity+ on their own. Of course, when combined with the
Coextensivity Thesis, these arguments support Normativity+. But
Kolodny's interpretation of what "a reason to be consistent" means
conflicts with the Coextensivity Thesis. So, while accuracy-dominance
arguments support Normativity-, it is an open question whether they also
support Normativity+.

Here is a response to my argument on behalf of the accuracy-dominance
theorist. We can regroup the consistent options in table 1 under a
single option. Call this the consistent option. With respect to the
consistent option, Snedegar's distinction does not apply. If there is
conclusive reason not to go for the inconsistent option, and the only
option left is the "regrouped" consistent option, then reasons against
inconsistency favour the consistent option. So, could there be a sense
in which the Coextensivity Thesis is true?[^17]

My response to this objection goes as follows. This way of framing the
problem cannot make sense of Kolodny's objection concerning some
consistent options. 
*There is something wrong with some consistent combinations of beliefs* 
--- some consistent combinations of beliefs are
entirely wrong or improbable on the evidence. Kolodny is right to point
out that nothing can be said in favour of these combinations of
attitudes. The only way to make sense of Kolodny's objection is *not* to
regroup all the consistent options under a single label, precisely
because relevant normative distinctions can (and should) be made between
some consistent options.

At best, this reply shows that, under a different interpretation of what
"a reason to be consistent" means, the Coextensivity Thesis is true. But
Kolodny's argument still succeeds relative to another interpretation of
this expression. When Kolodny discusses the normativity of Consistency,
he discusses the normativity of the individual consistent options one
has, including the ones that are entirely wrong or improbable on the
evidence. The accuracy-dominance theorist can claim that one ought to be
consistent, but that is simply because the expression "one ought to be
consistent" here refers to something logically weaker than what Kolodny
has in mind.[^18]

## An Escape Route for the Accuracy-Dominance Theorist?

The accuracy-dominance theorist could then offer the following
objection. Suppose there is an accuracy-dominance argument against one's
attitudes. Accordingly, one can identify at least one collection of
attitudes that veritistically dominates one's current state. If agents
can identify at least one set of attitudes that is better than their
current state, then they have a reason to take the dominating set of
attitudes, which will be consistent. Doesn't this support the view
according to which one ought to be consistent? If agents ought to take
dominating combinations of beliefs, and such combinations of beliefs are
consistent, then this seems to entail that agents ought to be
consistent.[^19]

This objection carries weight depending on what accuracy-dominance
arguments prove. Let me explain.

Suppose the contender is right. Then, accuracy-dominance vindications
are akin to the Truth Vindication, the Knowledge Vindication or the
Reasons Vindication discussed in [@sec:the-why-be-consistent-challenges]. If one has inconsistent combinations of beliefs (say, one believes $P$ and also believes $\neg$P), the
Truth Vindication says that agents ought to maintain the true one (and
abandon the false one), the Knowledge Vindication says that agents are
only permitted to maintain the known one, and the Reasons Vindication
says that agents are only permitted to maintain the reasonable one (and
ought to abandon the *unreasonable* one). In any case, satisfying such
norms means that agents will cease entertaining inconsistent
combinations of beliefs.

The contender makes a similar point. If one has inconsistent
combinations of beliefs, one should go for the option dominating
inconsistent combinations of beliefs. But if that is right, the
accuracy-dominance argument merely entails that agents ought (or have
reasons) to have *some* combinations of beliefs, not *any* consistent
combination of beliefs. In other words, the argument leaves out some
consistent combinations of beliefs.

This brings us back to the discussion in [@Sec:the-why-be-consistent-challenges]. 
What do we expect from a good vindication of the normativity of Consistency? For many
philosophers, a good vindication of Consistency should cover all the
possible consistent combinations of beliefs. If the contender is right,
then accuracy-dominance arguments can explain the significance of some
consistent combinations of beliefs --- namely, the dominating ones. But
this is not what we were looking for. The explanation should apply to
*all* the consistent combination of beliefs. To be clear: Some
philosophers might not be interested in this specific interpretation of
the "Why-Be-Consistent" debate. It should be clear that, with respect to
other understandings of the question, the contender is right.

# Conclusion and Implications in the Debate On The Normativity of Structural Rationality

This paper supports the view that there are two theses concerning the
normativity of Consistency: Normativity+ and Normativity-. While
accuracy-dominance arguments support Normativity-, they might not
necessarily support Normativity+. This is so, because the Coextensivity
Thesis might be false. In fact, one way to reconcile Kolodny's objection
from truth-conduciveness with accuracy-dominance arguments is to deny
the Coextensivity Thesis.

These clarifications concerning Normativity+ and Normativity- allow us
to rethink the debate on the normativity of structural rationality.
Indeed, a popular strategy for arguing against the normativity of
structural rationality is to point out that there is no reason to
satisfy some specific rational requirements (such as Consistency).
Kolodny's objection from truth-conduciveness is a good illustration of
such arguments. These arguments are compelling if we focus on
Normativity+. But this might be a mistake. Perhaps that, when it comes
to formal requirements like Consistency, the only view we should try to
vindicate is Normativity-.

The argument of this paper allows us to make sense of some
pre-theoretically correct assumptions structural requirements of
epistemic rationality such as Consistency. Plausibly, there is something
wrong, suboptimal or disvaluable with inconsistent combinations of
beliefs. The mistake might have been to try to explain this assumption
in terms of *an obligation to be consistent*. But if I am right, we
might only be able to explain this assumption in terms of *an obligation
not to be inconsistent*. Hence, requirements like Consistency might
merely be normative in a weak sense.

The good news is that we can now make sense of such a possibility. If
the Coextensivity Thesis is false, it makes perfect sense to say that
one ought not to be inconsistent without also saying that one ought to
be consistent. There might not be something good with being structurally
rational, but it seems patently clear that there is something bad with
being structurally irrational.

[^4]: In fact, @broome:2013 [ch. 11]  is interested in the stronger
    claim that rationality is a *source* of normativity. So, he is not
    interested in offering a derivative vindication of consistency
    requirements, that is, a vindication of these requirements on other
    grounds (like truth, knowledge, or reasons). By contrast, dominance
    principles are often tied to rationality [see e.g. @joyce_jm:1998].

[^5]: @coates_a:2012 and @lasonenaarnio:2020 have argued that
    responding correctly to one's evidence sometimes entail believing
    "P, but I am irrational to believe P", which is an incoherent
    combination of attitudes. They conclude that such incoherence is not
    necessarily irrational. See @greco_d:2014, @horowitz_s:2014a,

[^7]: I'm glossing over some inessential subtleties here. It is possible
    to assign a value to not believing $P$ (or to withholding judgment on
    whether P), but ultimately, we would get exactly the same results.

    epistemology. See @steinberger_f:2019a and the next footnote.

    favour of the conservative account of epistemic value. See

    compatible with accuracy-first epistemology.

    for a similar but contextualist view.

[^18]: My response might not convince some readers. In any case, we can
    draw a lesson from this discussion. We have learned that the
    expression "a reason to be consistent" is ambiguous. Some readings
    of this expression are a problem for Kolodny's argument, and other
    readings of this expression conflict with vindicating Normativity+.
