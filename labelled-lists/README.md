Introduction
------------

This filter provides custom labelled lists in Pandoc's markdown for
outputs in LaTeX/PDF, HTML and JATS XML. Instead of bullets or
numbers, list items are given custom text labels. The text labels can
include markdown formatting. 

Usage
-----

### Loading the filter

The filter is loaded with the Pandoc `-L` or `--lua-filter` option. 

```bash pandoc -L path/to/labelled-lists.lua source.md -o output.html
```

If the filter is in Pandoc's `$DATADIR` there is no need to give its
path. See [Pandoc's manual[
(https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#general-options) for details.

### Markdown syntax

A simple illustration of the custom label syntax:

```markdown
* [Premise 1]{} This is the first claim.
* [Premise 2]{} This is the second claim.
* [Conclusion]{} This is the conclusion.
```

This generates the following list (process this file with the filter
to see the result):

* [Premise 1]{} This is the first claim.
* [Premise 2]{} This is the second claim.
* [Conclusion]{} This is the conclusion.

In general, the filter will turn a bullet list into a custom label
list provided that *every item starts with a non-empty Span
element*.

* A Span element is inline text (i.e., not block like a paragraph)
  that optinally has some attributes. The default syntax is `
  [inline text]{attributes}`. Inline text will be used as label, 
  placed within round bracket. 
* There is no need to specify attributes on the Span. But curly
  brackets must be present: `[label]` won't work, `[label]{}` will.
* The label can include formatting. `[**T1**]{}` will generate a label with
  strong emphasis (bold by default).
* For the purposes of this filter, a Span is *non-empty* if its inline
  text is not empty. Thus `[]{}` will not work. Numbers or other unicode
  characters work. To generate an empty
  label, use a space or other invisible character, e.g. `[ ]
  {}`. *Exception*: math formulas will work as labels, but if the inline 
  text only contains LaTeX code (`\textsc{a}`) it will be treated as empty.
* Span elements can also be entered using HTML syntax: `<span>inline text
  </span>`. See [Pandoc manual]
  (https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#divs-and-spans) for details. 

### Customizing the label delimiters

By default the custom lable is put between two parentheses. You can change
this globally by setting a `delimiter` key within a `labelled-lists` key in 
your document's metadata.

```yaml
labelled-lists:
  delimiter: )
```

Possible values:

* `''` or 'none' (empty string) for no delimiter
* `()` or `(` or `TwoParens` for "(Label)" (default)
* `.` or `Period` for a dot "Label."
* `)` or `OneParen` for "Label)"
* `...%1...` for arbitrary delimiters, e.g. `|%1|` for "|Label|", "%1--" for  
  `Label--` and so on. These characters are interpreted literally, not 
  as markdown: `*%1*` will surround your label with asterisks, not make
  it italic.

This can be set for a specific list by using a `delimiter` 
attribute on the first
span element of your list (same possible values as above):

```markdown
* [Premise 1]{delimiter='**%1**'} This is the first claim.
* [Premise 2]{} This is the second claim.
* [Conclusion]{} This is the conclusion.
```

* [Premise 1]{delimiter='**%1**'} This is the first claim.
* [Premise 2]{} This is the second claim.
* [Conclusion]{} This is the conclusion.


### Cross-referencing custom-label items

Custom labels can be given internal identifiers. The syntax is 
`[label]{#identifier}`. In the list below, `A1ref`, `A2ref` and
`Cref` identify the item:

```markdown
* [**A1**]{#A1ref} This is the first claim.
* [A2]{#A2ref} This is the second claim.
* [*C*]{#Cref} This is the conclusion.
```

Note that `#` is not part of the identifier. Identifiers should start 
with a letter and contain only letters, digits, colons `:`, dots `.`,
dashes `-` and underscores `_`. 

Labels with identifiers can be crossreferenced using 
Pandoc's citations or internal links.

#### Cross-referencing with citations

The basic syntax is:

* Reference in text: `@A1ref`. Outputs the label with its formatting: **A1**.
* Normal reference: `[@A1ref]`. Outputs the label with its formatting, 
  in parentheses: (**A1**). A prefix and suffix can be specified too:
  `[remember @A1ref and the like]` will output (remember **A1** and the like).
* The suppressed author style, `[-@A1ref]`, will be processed 
  as normal reference: label with its formatting in parentheses.

You can crossrefer to several custom labels at a time: 
`[@A1ref; @A2ref]`. But mixing references to a custom label
with bibliographic ones in a same citation won't work: if
`Smith2003` is a key in your bibliography `[@A1ref; Smith2003]`
will only output "(@A1ref; Smith, 2003)".

Because this syntax overlaps with Pandoc's citation syntax, conflicts
should be avoided:

* Avoid giving the same identifier (e.g. `Smith2005`) to 
  a custom label item and a bibliographic entry. If that happens,
  the citation will be interpreted as crossreference to the custom
  label item. To make sure you you may use identifiers starting 
  with `item:`: `item:A1ref`, `item:A2ref`, or some other prefix.
* The filter should preferably be run before `citeproc`, and 
  before other filters that use citations (like `pandoc-crossref`). 
  It may work properly even if it is run after, though `citeproc` 
  will issue "citations not found" warnings. To ensure that
  the filter is run before, just place it before in the 
  command line or in your YAML options file's `filters` field.

Alternatively, the citation syntax for crossreferencing 
custom label items can be deactivated. 
See [Customization] below. 

#### Cross-referencing with internal links

In Pandoc markdown internal links are created with the syntax `[link 
text](#target_identifier)`. (Note the rounded brackets instead of
curly ones for Span element identifiers.) You can use internal
links to cross-refer to custom label items that have a identifier.
If your link has no text, the label with its formatting will be
printed out; otherwise whichever text you give for the link. 
For instance, given the custom label list above, the following:

```markdown
The claim [](#A1ref) together with [the next claim](#A2ref) 
entail ([](#Cref)).
```

will output:

> The claim [**A1**]() together with [the next claim]() entail ([*C*]()).

where the links point to the corresponding items in the list. 

### Customization

Filter options can be specified in the document's metadata (YAML block)
as follows:

```markdown
---
title: My document
author: John Doe
labelled-lists:
  disable-citations: true
  delimiter: Period
```

That is the metadata field `labelled-lists` contains the filter options as
a map. Presently the filter has just one option:

* `disable-citations`: if true, the filter will not process cross-references
  made with the citation syntax. (default: false)

Examples and tests
------------------

### math formulas

* [$p_1$]{} This list uses
* [$p_2$]{} math formulas as labels.

### LaTeX code

* [\textbf{a}]{} This list uses
* [\textbf{b}]{} latex code as labels.

Ignored: these are not treated as labels.

### Small caps

* [[All]{.smallcaps}]{} This list uses
* [[Some]{.smallcaps}]{} latex code as labels.

### List with Para items

* [A1]{} $$F(x) > G(x)$$
* [A2]{} $$G(x) > H(x)$$

### items with several blocks
* [**B1**]{} This list's items

    consist of several blocks

    $$\sum_i Fi > \sum_i Gi$$

* [**B2**]{} Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec et
  massa ut eros volutpat gravida ut vel lacus. Proin turpis eros, imperdiet sed
  quam eget, bibendum aliquam massa. Phasellus pellentesque egestas dapibus.
  Proin porta tellus id orci consectetur bibendum. Nam eu cursus quam. Etiam
  vehicula in mi sed interdum. Duis rutrum eleifend consectetur. Phasellus
  ullamcorper, urna at vestibulum venenatis, tellus erat luctus nibh, eget
  hendrerit justo enim nec magna. Duis mollis ac felis ac tristique.

  Pellentesque malesuada arcu ac orci scelerisque vulputate. Aenean at ex
  suscipit, ultricies tellus sit amet, luctus lectus. Duis ut viverra sapien.
  Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac
  turpis egestas. Cras consequat nisi at ex finibus, in condimentum erat auctor.
  In at nulla at est iaculis pulvinar sed id diam. Cras malesuada sit amet tellus id molestie.

### cross-reference with citation syntax

* [**B1**]{#B1ref} This is the first claim.
* [B2]{#B2ref} This is the second claim.
* [*D*]{#Dref} This is the conclusion.

The claim @B1ref together with the claim @B2ref 
entail [@Dref].

### cross-reference with internal link syntax

* [**A1**]{#A1ref} This is the first claim.
* [A2]{#A2ref} This is the second claim.
* [*C*]{#Cref} This is the conclusion.

The claim [](#A1ref) together with the claim [](#A2ref) 
entail ([](#Cref)).

### LaTeX output

```latex
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

\item[(Premise 1)] This is the first claim.

\item[(Premise 2)] This is the second claim.

\item[(Conclusion)] This is the conclusion.

\end{itemize}
```

### HTML output

HTML output is a `<div>`. Each item is a `<p>` if it's one block long,
  a `<div>` if longer. The label itself is contained in a `<span>`. 

```html
<div class="labelled-lists-list">
  <p class="labelled-lists-item"><span class="labelled-lists-label">(Premise 1)</span> This is the first claim.</p>
  <p class="labelled-lists-item"><span class="labelled-lists-label">(Premise 2)</span> This is the second claim.</p>
  <div class="labelled-lists-item">
    <p><span class="labelled-lists-label">(<strong>Conclusion</strong>)</span> This third item consists of</p>
    <p>two blocks.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### List structures

* In the Pandoc AST, each item is a list of blocks. If the item has 
 only one block, the list will contain only one element. 
* If an item has only one block, that block's type can be at least:
  - Plain, if it only contains straightforward markdown
  - Para, if it contains some equation LaTeX code (and perhaps in other
   cases too)
  - Table if it contains a table. 
* It an item has several blocks, they will be Para by default, 
  otherwise of whatever type the block is. 
* If an item is only one block, it is either a Plain element (if it 
  only contains straightforward markdown) or a Para element (if it 
  contains some LaTeX code or equation)
